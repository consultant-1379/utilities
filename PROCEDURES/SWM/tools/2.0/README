  * createDpRepo.sh       - Prepares the DP-repo;
  * createCsm.sh          - Contains embedded rules for creating the APG CSM Model
                            using the DP-repo;
  * applyPatches.sh       - Apply a patch in LDE runtime package to remove completely ECIM Equipment (waiting for the solution in CoreMW 4.7)

PREREQUISITES:

  Create under $SWM_2_HOME/workspace/am-ws the configuration file ArtifactManager.cfg
  User can copy the template ArtifactManager.cfg.template file available in $SWM_2_HOME/workspace/am-ws 
  location and update it with user values

  1) Copy the files:
     cp ArtifactManager_ap.cfg.template ArtifactManager_ap.cfg and
     cp ArtifactManager_all.cfg.template ArtifactManager_all.cfg

  2) Fetch the encrypted password from  https://arm.deac.rnd.ericsson.se/artifactory/  and update in ArtifactManager_ap.cfg

  3) Fetch the encrypted password from  https://arm.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se/artifactory/ and update in ArtifactManager_all.cfg

  4) In both the copied files, Replace the path in the variables cachelocation and softwareRepo with current user's path
     for e.g. if the repository exists in /home/<username>/GIT_DIR/utilities path then
     softwareRepo = file:///home/<username>/GIT_DIR/utilities/PROCEDURES/SWM/workspace/local-sw
     and cachelocation = /home/<username>/GIT_DIR/utilities/PROCEDURES/SWM/workspace/am-cache

  Follow the instructions in the template ArtifactManager.cfg.template  
 
  check-out $SWM_2_HOME/tool/model/apg-version.yml file.
  Update product-number column with current R-state, Here product number is constant only modify R-state.

  For example how to modify in apg-version.yml
  Current R-state, product-number: CXP9040501R7A02
  Modifiled R-state, product-number: CXP9040501R7A03 
  contents of apg-version.yml
    systems: 
    - uid: APG43L 
      name: APG43L 
      version: 3.6.0 
      product-number: CXP9040501R7A03 
      description: APG43L 

   After modifying "product-number" attribute check-in  apg-version.yml  file.
  
HOW-TO
  source modules.sh
  ./createDpRepo.sh
  ./createCsm.sh
  ./applyPatches.sh
  ./createCsp.sh
