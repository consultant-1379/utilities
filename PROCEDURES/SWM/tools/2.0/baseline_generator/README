README
  APG Offline Baseline Creation is intended to generate the baseline file for
  different configurations during package creation.

FILES
  * createBaseline.sh              - Collects all the rpms from the Runtime 
			             packages and generates md5 checksum for 
				     all rpm content files.
  * baseline_filter.sh             - Filters out unnecessary files that to be
				     excluded from the baseline file.
  * baseline_infraspecific.sh      - Update the baseline file with respect to
				     the infrastructure selected.
  * acs_lct_integrityAP_base.conf  - Configuration file that defines inclusion 
				     or exclusion of a file in baseline file.
  * directoryStructure             - Contains all the directory paths of generic 
				     APG directory structure that are skipped
				     during the generation of baseline file. 
				     This file content will be appended to 
				     baseline file. 


PREREQUISITES:
  Inorder to create Baseline files Offline the "acs_lct_integrityAP_base.conf"
  should be up to data and to be synced with the same in acs_lct.
  All the runtime packages should be generated before generating baseline files.
  
HOW-TO
  source modules.sh
  ./createDpRepo.sh
  ./createCsm.sh
  ./applyPatches.sh
  ./createBaseline.sh

HOW-TO-CHANGE
* acs_lct_integrityAP_base.conf    - Refer to opening comments in the same 
				     file. All the changes updated in the file
				     should be synced with file in acs_lct 
				     subsystem.
  E.g.,
  <DirPath> [true|false] [+|-] [files]
  DirPath : Absolute path of directory
  true    : Including all the files in given DirPath if exclusion files are 
  	    not provided
  false   : Excluding all the files in given DirPath if inclusion files are 
	    not provided
  +       : to include
  -       : to exclude
  files   : file names to be included/excluded	

  "/usr/bin/" false 		   - This defines all the files under 
				     "/usr/bin" are excluded
  "/usr/bin/" true		   - This defines all the files under
                                     "/usr/bin" are included
  "/usr/bin/" false + file1 file2  - This defines all the files except file1 
				     and file2 are excluded
  "/usr/bin/" true  - file1 file2  - This defines all the files except file1
                                     and file2 are included

  Including /usr/bin/zip
  "usr/bin/" false + zip	   - This includes /usr/bin/zip for integrity
				     check
  Excluding /usr/bin/zip
  "usr/bin/" true - zip		   - This excludes /usr/bin/zip for integrity
				     check
* directoryStructure
  The file contains all the missing directory entries of baseline file
  and are introduced to respective infrastructure based baseline files
  ADD
  	To Add a new entry add a new line with the directory path in the directoryStructure file
  REMOVE
	To Remove an existing entry remove the line containing respective directory path from directoryStructure file
